# foodfestival

This project focuses on if-else statements and while loops. It's a basic program themed as a food festival that consists of a menu with vegan/vegetarian food options, asks for age when requesting wine, and gives you a total cost when you're finished. Cash and Debit/Credit Card accepted.
